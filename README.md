> I use paru (AUR helper) so if you'll use yay then remove the ``alias yay="paru"`` line in ``/.config/fish/config.fish``

> If you are not using nvidia gpu you should delete the nvidia fix env's in ``/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf``

### Guide to apply spicetify matugen theme

1. Install and apply spicetify correctly.

2. Download my dotfiles and put spicetify files to the correct location.

3. Run these commands

```
spicetify config current_theme Ziro
spicetify config color_scheme blue-dark
spicetify config custom_apps marketplace
```

4. Done! You have to type ``spicetify apply`` to reload Spotify when you change your wallpaper. (I don't want to automate this via scripts since it can behave bad. Manually reloading it generally works better)

> [!NOTE]
> You can't (and shouldn't) change your theme through marketplace with this config but you can use extensions and other stuff.

> If you want to change your theme through marketplace (matugen won't work) run ``spicetify config current_theme marketplace``
